# liferay-npm-bundler

A tool to process a Liferay portlet project to produce an OSGi bundle containing
the needed npm dependencies so that it can be run when deployed to the Portal.

This tool is of a kind known as bundler, like
[browserify](http://browserify.org/) or [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/).

So, why writing another bundler? The main reason is that due to the modularity
of Liferay Portal, several portlets that don't know each other in advance may
need to cooperate to share their Javascript dependencies, so we cannot just
deploy all Javascript in a single file like other bundlers do for web
applications.

On the contrary, we need to bundle enough information so that the Portal can
-when assembling a page- determine which packages must be used and how they are
going to be shared among different portlets.

And that's where `liferay-npm-bundler` comes in handy.

## Installation

```sh
npm install --save-dev liferay-npm-bundler
```

## Usage

Usually `liferay-npm-bundler` is called in your `package.json` build script
after all transpilation and processing has taken place.

To do so, you must have something similar to this in your `package.json` file:

```json
"scripts": {
    "build": "... && liferay-npm-bundler"
}
```

Where the `...` refers to any previous step you need to perform like, for
example, transpiling your sources with Babel.

The output of `liferay-npm-bundler` is a directory that is suitable for
deploying npm packages to Liferay Portal as explained in
[this project's root README file](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-npm-build-tools/blob/master/README.md).

This tool is configured by means of a `.npmbundlerrc` file that must live inside
the project's root folder. Continue reading to know how to write such file.

## How it works internally

This tool assumes a Liferay portlet project as input and outputs its files to a
`build` directory so that the standard Gradle build for portlets can carry on
and produce an OSGi bundle that can be deployed to Liferay Portal.

To do so, it runs the project source files through the following workflow:

1. Copy project's `package.json` file to the output directory.
2. Traverse project's dependency tree to determine which packages are needed to
	run it.
3. For each dependency package:

	1. Copy package to output dir (in plain _package_@_version_ format, as
		opposed to the standard `node_modules` tree format).
	2. Pre-process package with configured plugins.
	3. Run Babel through each `.js` file in the package with configured plugins.
	4. Post-process package with configured plugins.

The pre and post process steps are the same, they only differ in the moment when
they are run (before or after Babel is run, respectively). In these steps,
`liferay-npm-bundler` calls all the configured plugins so that they can perform
transformations on the npm packages like, for instance, modifying its
`package.json` file, or deleting or moving files.

Let's see an example with the following `.npmbundlerrc` file:

```json
{
	"preset": "liferay-npm-bundler-preset-standard"
}
```

If we run `liferay-npm-bundler` with this file, it will apply the
[config file](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-npm-build-tools/blob/master/packages/liferay-npm-bundler-preset-standard/config.json)
found in `liferay-npm-bundler-preset-standard`:

```json
{
	"*": {
		"plugins": ["replace-browser-modules"],
		".babelrc": {
			"presets": ["liferay-standard"]
		}
	}
}
```

This states that for all npm packages (`*`) the pre-process phase (`plugins`)
must run the `replace-browser-modules` plugin (if we wanted to run that plugin
during the post phase, it should say `post-plugins` instead of `plugins`).

Looking at the
[documentation](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-npm-build-tools/blob/master/packages/liferay-npm-bundler-plugin-replace-browser-modules/README.md)
of replace-browser-modules plugin we can see that this plugin replaces
Javascript modules as defined under the `browser` section of `package.json`
files. This means that, for each npm package that our project has as dependency,
`liferay-npm-bundler` will make sure that each one having a `browser` section in
its `package.json` files will have its server side files replaced by their
counterpart browser versions.

The next part of the `.npmbundlerrc` file specifies the `.babelrc` file to use
when running Babel through the packages `.js` files. Please keep in mind that,
in this phase, Babel is used to transform package files (for example to convert
them to AMD format if necessary) not to transpile them (though, in theory, you
could transpile them too if you wanted by configuring the proper plugins).

In this example, we use the `liferay-standard` preset, that applies the
following plugins according to
[its documentation](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-npm-build-tools/tree/master/packages/babel-preset-liferay-amd):

1. [babel-plugin-normalize-requires](https://github.com/izaera/liferay-npm-build-tools/tree/master/packages/babel-plugin-normalize-requires)
2. [babel-plugin-transform-node-env-inline](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-transform-node-env-inline)
3. [babel-plugin-wrap-modules-amd](https://github.com/izaera/liferay-npm-build-tools/tree/master/packages/babel-plugin-wrap-modules-amd)
4. [babel-plugin-name-amd-modules](https://github.com/izaera/liferay-npm-build-tools/tree/master/packages/babel-plugin-name-amd-modules)
5. [babel-plugin-namespace-amd-define](https://github.com/izaera/liferay-npm-build-tools/tree/master/packages/babel-plugin-namespace-amd-define)

Checking the documentation of these plugins we find out that Babel will:

1. Remove trailing `.js` strings from `require()` calls in our packages.
2. Replace occurrences of `process.env.NODE_ENV` by its literal value.
3. Wrap modules with an AMD `define()` call.
4. Give a canonical name to each AMD module based on its package and relative
	path inside it.
5. Prefix `define()` calls with `Liferay.Loader.`.

Thus, after running `liferay-npm-bundler` on our project we will have a folder
with all our npm dependencies extracted from the project's `node_modules` folder
and modified to make them work on Liferay Portal under management of its
[Liferay AMD Loader](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-amd-loader).

## Configuration

As said before, `liferay-npm-bundler` is configured placing a `.npmbundlerrc`
file in your project's folder. The full structure of that file is:

```
{
    "exclude": {
        "*" : [
            <list of glob expressions excluding files>
        ],
        "<package name>" : [
            <same as for "*">
        ],
        "<package name>@<version>" : [
            <same as for "*">
        ]
    },
    "include-dependencies": {
        "<package name>", ...
    },
    "output": <relative path of output directory>,
    "process-serially": <true|false>,
    "dump-report": <true|false>,
    "verbose": <true|false>,
    "global-config": {
        ...
    },
    "/": {
        "plugins": [
            <list of plugins>
		],
        ".babelrc": {
            <standard .babelrc file>
		},
        "post-plugins": [
            <list of plugins>
		]
    },
    "*" : {
        "plugins": [
            <list of plugins>
		],
        ".babelrc": {
            <standard .babelrc file>
		},
        "post-plugins": [
            <list of plugins>
		]
    },
    "packages": {
        "<package name>" : {
            <same as for "*">
        },
        "<package name>@<version>" : {
            <same as for "*">
        }
    }
    ...
}
```

Where:

* **"exclude"**: defines files to be excluded from bundling from all or specific
	packages.
* **"include-dependencies"**: defines packages to be included in bundling even
	if they are not listed under the `dependencies` section of `package.json`.
	Obviously, the packages must be available in the `node_modules` folder so,
	either they are installed manually without saving them to `package.json` or
	they are listed in the `devDependencies` section.
* **"output"**: by default the bundled packages are written to
	`build/resources/main/META-INF/resources`, which is the standard Gradle output
	directory for resources, but it can be overriden for customized builds.
* **"process-serially"**: defines whether to process dependency packages in
	parallel, leveraging Node.js asynchronous model, or one by one. The default
	value is false, so that everything gets processed in parallel, but you can
	disable it in case you get EMFILE errors due to opening too many files at the
	same time.
* **"dump-report"**: write a report HTML file in the project directory with
	details about how each package is transformed and what has been done.
* **"verbose"**: dump detailed information about what the tool is doing to the
	console.
* **"global-config"**: global configuration which is passed to all bundler and
	Babel plugins.
* **(list of plugins)**: is a comma separated list of strings defining the
	`liferay-npm-bundler` plugins to call (note that the
	`liferay-npm-bundler-plugin-` part from the npm package name may be omitted).
* **(standard .babelrc file)**: is a `.babelrc` file as defined in
	[Babel's documentation](https://babeljs.io/docs/usage/babelrc/) that gets
	passed to Babel when called by `liferay-npm-bundler`.
* **(package name)**: is a npm package name and the configuration under its
	scope will be only applied to packages with that name and _any_ version.
* **(version)**: is a npm package version and the configuration under its
	`<package name>@<version>` scope will be only applied to packages with that
	specific name and version.

> Note that, prior to version 1.4.0, the `packages` section did not exist and

    package configurations where placed next to the tools options (like `*`,
	`output`, `exclude`, and so on). This created the possibility of a collision
	and thus, the package configurations were namespaced. However, the tool still
	falls back to the root section (outside `packages`) for packages configuration
	to maintain backwards compatibility.
